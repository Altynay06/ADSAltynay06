# Java Data Structures Project

This is my project for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course.  
I manually implemented the following data structures in Java:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Dynamic Array (ArrayList)
- Min Heap

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Go to the `Main.java` file inside the task folder
3. Click **Run**

Each task is placed in a separate folder:
- `Task1` â€” Linked List
- `Task2` â€” Stack and Queue
- `Task3` â€” Min Heap

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal of this project was to understand how data structures work internally.  
All algorithms are written without using Javaâ€™s built-in structures.  
This project also helped me get comfortable with GitHub and version control.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

While working on this project, I learned how to build common data structures,  
write clean code in Java, and organize a project properly.
